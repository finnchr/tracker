# Problem description

The purpose of my app is to create and save tracks. Details about the track and it's path are updated when
a new coordinate is received from the GPS-sensor. The app has views that let you see details about the track;
when it was created, distance, max/min altitude, duration and its path in Google maps. You can at any time
upload the track to RunKeeper. You can also share the track with other apps, the track is then shared as a
GPX-file.

I've removed the API-keys (Google Maps and RunKeeper) before I uploaded the code to GitHub. I'm not sure if
you'll need these or if you'll create your own keys. Please let me know if you need me to send you my keys.
I've added placeholders for the keys so the code will compile. You'll find the placeholders in
tracker/app/src/main/res/values/apikeys.xml

# Mockups

I've provided screenshots (in the folder Screenshots) of my app to demonstrate its functionality.
Tracks.png: This is the first view you'll see when the app is started. This view lists all tracks and let
you delelete tracks (click the trashcan icon) and create new tracks (click the plus icon on the action bar).
You can also open settings by opening the options meny and select settings. Click on a track to select it.

### TrackDetailsInfo.png
When you select a track this is what you'll see. This view gives you information about the track, like when
it was created, distance, duration, max/min altitude and when (if) it was uploaded to RunKeeper.

### TrackDetailsMap.png
This view shows the track in Google maps. You can swipe between this view and previous view.

### Settings.png
This shows the settings view. You can select interval (in seconds) between updates and distance between
updates (in meteres).

### TracksAndDetailInfo-land.png and TracksAndDetailMap-land.png
Shows the track list and details view when in landscape mode. As you can see the list of tracks appear on
the left hand side of the screen, while the details view appear on the right hand side.
