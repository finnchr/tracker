The purpose of my app is to create and save tracks. Details about the track and it's path are updated when
a new coordinate is received from the GPS-sensor. The app has views that let you see details about the track;
when it was created, distance, max/min altitude, duration and its path in Google maps. You can at any time
upload the track to RunKeeper. You can also share the track with other apps, the track is then shared as a
GPX-file.

I've removed the API-keys (Google Maps and RunKeeper) before I uploaded the code to GitHub. I'm not sure if
you'll need these or if you'll create your own keys. Please let me know if you need me to send you my keys.
I've added placeholders for the keys so the code will compile. You'll find the placeholders in
tracker/app/src/main/res/values/apikeys.xml

English is not my native language so please excuse me for any typos or poor language.
